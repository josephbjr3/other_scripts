This script scrapes the company name, job title, and url from bookmarks in an exported bookmark html file and outputs it to a csv. 

I will then import the csv into Salesforce for my job tracking project.


How to use:
- Execute the the following terminal command "python script_name.py /path/to/input.html /path/to/output.csv"

- Be sure that you're in the current working directory of the python file when running. Otherwise, you will have to add the file path of the python file

- Replace '/path/to/input.html' with the file path to your export html file.

- Replace 'path/to/output.csv' with the file path where you want the csv to save.
